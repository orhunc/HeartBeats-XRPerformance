# XR-LivePerformance

The XR performance installation "HeartBeats" is the result of a research project by TU Berlin and Empiria Theatre Zagreb. The goal of the research was the development of an interaction concept using XR to create experiences for an artistic performance.

The core inspiration behind this XR installation was the trend of using data to re-create. We wanted to explore working with "unconventional" data that have been so far explored less in the context of performing arts. Bio-signals such as heart rate, EEG, EMG have a promising quality that can allow performers a brand-new spectrum of possibilities for artmaking. For this project, we decided to work with the heart rate element to create a performance.
